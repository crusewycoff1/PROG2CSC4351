### What works
- Printing out the AST should be working
- Syntax other than arrays with finite size works
- Linking to Absyn files works.

### What doesn't work
- Arrays with finite size when declared at initialization
- Couldn't get arraylists to work in Grm.cup, was throwing complicated errors. Just used linkedlists instead.

### To Run
- Run test.sh
